Is a simple CRUD application built on top of a custom MVC Framework coded by myself, with the help of Brad Traversy in his course, Object Orientated PHP & MVC.
This is not my first custom MVC application however it is my first MVC application built in PHP as the previous one was built in Javascript.

## Goal
To build a functional application, using PHP by creating a custom MVC framework and then building the applciation on top.  I have also used bootstrap, to throw up a quick GUI, however if this was a production rather than a technical exercise, I would have put a lot more effort into styling maybe using a bootstrap theme or my preference going freehand with the CSS.
